### Derpi Downloader

- Current stage: **Release**

- This program allows you to mass download images from derpibooru.org in **task** mode (which allows you to utilize your Internet connection with an efficiency close to **100%**).
- Although the program currently in release stage, it requires general and stability testing on various configurations.
- To use: add a task, enter a search query with derpibooru.org search syntax (example: artist:X), click download.
Images will be downloaded and sorted according to request.

- **P.S. I need feedback - your ideas and messages about bugs / crashes.**
